1) Given a partially filled in Sudoku board and a set of coordinates in that board pointing to an empty square, write a function that returns a list containing all numbers that the empty square could be

    Input: sudokuBoard:[[Int?]]. (Each location on the board will be either be an Int from 1-9 or nil(empty cell))
    row: Int
    col: Int
*/

func getValidNumbers(sudokuBoard:[[Int?]], row:Int, col:Int) -> [Int] {
    
    
    return []
}



/*

2)rotate a matrix by ninety degrees
Input: matrix:[[Int]]
Output: matrix: [[Int]]

Sample Input: [ [1][2][3][4],
[5][6][7][8],
[9][0][1][2],
[3][4][5][6] ]
Sample Output: [ [3][9][5][1],
[4][0][6][2],
[5][1][7][3],
[6][2][8][4] ]

3)Design an optimal algorithm for sorting four elements A, B, C, and D. 
    
    By optimal, I mean one that sorts using the minimum number of comparisons.
    Hint: you may want to start by putting the first two items in order 
    and the last two items in order... that takes two comparisons. 

    How many more comparisons do you need to find the minimum element? The maximum? 
    Once youâ€™ve found the min and max, what if any additional comparisons are needed?
